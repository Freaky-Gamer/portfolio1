<p id="p01">I am a sixteen year-old girl who lives in the small town of North Berwick, 
Maine. I joined <abbr title="Girls Who Code">GWC</abbr> as to complete the 
<abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math">S.T.E.M</abbr> that 
my school gives out every year to a graduating applicant that meets several 
requirements. One of the requirements for the endorsement is to have two 
<abbr title="Extended Learning Opportunity">E.L.Os</abbr>. I have already 
completed one of the E.L.Os last Summer when I went to a computer building camp.

  <p>"This is a game that me and a few other girls made. My friend Gabby drew the fish and the background. 
  Catherine came up with the actual idea of the game. And Pei Yoa coded a bubble that floats across the screen from time to
  time that helps you win the game. The objective was to avoid the fish, and catch the bubbles for air.</p>
