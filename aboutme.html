<p id="main" style="text-align:center; display=none;">I am a sixteen year-old girl who lives in the small town of North Berwick, Maine.
I joined <abbr title="Girls Who Code">GWC</abbr> as to complete the <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Math">S.T.E.M</abbr> that my school gives out every year to a graduating applicant that meets several requirements. One of the 
requirements for the endorsement is to have two <abbr title="Extended Learning Opportunity">E.L.Os</abbr>. I have already completed 
one of the E.L.Os last Summer when I went to a computer building camp."</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:left;">FunFact</h3>
  <p>I want to be a video game designer.</p>
<!--a fun fact about me-->
  
  <img src="Capture.PNG" alt="Game made on a website called scratch" width="200" height="150">
<!--This should display an image of the scratch game that me and two others made with the discription below in lines 76-79-->
  
  <p>This is a game that me and a few other girls made. My friend Gabby drew the fish and the background. 
  Catherine came up with the actual idea of the game. And Pei Yoa coded a bubble that floats across the screen from time to
  time that helps you win the game. The objective was to avoid the fish, and catch the bubbles for air.</p>
